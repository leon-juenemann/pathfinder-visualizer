Pathfinding Visualizer Website https://leon-juenemann.github.io/pathfinder-visualizer

build purposly only in vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS

You can do:
- animate different pathfinding algorithms
- click on end/start tile and change its position
- draw obstacles on the grid
- draw a maze using maze generation algorithmns
- change the animation speed

Code is pretty messy still. Especially the algorithms code.
